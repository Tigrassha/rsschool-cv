I want to explore the development front and become a developer to change the scope of activities, increase my income and move to another country. I carefully study the new information and try to apply it in practice. While I do not have work experience, I have the goal to acquire suitable skills, find a job and develop in this field.

I have initial skills HTML5, CSS, Git.

Education is secondary specialized.

The level of proficiency in English A2, but I am actively studying it.
